# CoolCycle
A simple program with graphical user interface for calculating performance figures of refrigeration cycle based on measuring key pressure and temperature values written in Java. It also draws a p-h diagram based on entered data. So far it works only with r1234yf refrigerant.
The executable .jar file can be copied to a Windows machine and if there is the latest Java RE installed the program should work. I removed one large library file that is most likely unneccesary as the code still executes on my computer.
In the src\Main folder you can see the written code. Note that only the .fxml files are autogenerated by the JavaFX Scene Builder.
